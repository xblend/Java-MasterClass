How Objects are stored in ArrayList?
The elements of the ArrayLists are the addresses where the objects are stored.
Eg: A sample ArrayList of Object E might look like
    Index   |  64bit(8byte) consecutive  memory locations  |    Value               Address     |       Object E
            |  In 64bit machines memory address is stored in 64bits                             |
    0       |              1024                            |    1024                  1000      |       E2
    1       |              1032                            |    1000                  1024      |       E1
    2       |              1040                            |    2024                  1996      |       E4
    3       |              1048                            |    1996                  2024      |       E3
    4       |              1056                            |    3600                  3600      |       E5


How primitive data types are stored in Array?
The elements of the Array of primitive data types stores the value.
Eg: A sample Array of int type might look like
    Index   |  32bit(4byte) consecutive  memory locations as int takes 4byte space  |    Value
    0       |              1020                                                     |    0
    1       |              1024                                                     |    1
    2       |              1028                                                     |    2
    3       |              1032                                                     |    4
    4       |              1036                                                     |    3

Eg: A sample Array of char type might look like
    Index   |  8bit(1byte) consecutive  memory locations as char takes 1byte space  |    Value
    0       |              1000                                                     |    'a'
    1       |              1001                                                     |    'b'
    2       |              1002                                                     |    'd'
    3       |              1003                                                     |    'f'
    4       |              1004                                                     |    'g'


How ArrayList is slower than LinkedList?
Consider an ArrayList containing millions of elements.
If we try to insert or remove an element in such a big ArrayList it will take a lot of computational time to shift down
or up the consequent elements present in that ArrayList
With LinkedList insertion and removal requires less computational time as we can insert or remove the nodes and no
shifting of consequent elements is required.
However, iterating through ArrayList is much faster than LinkedList.
In array list or arrays we can get the memory location of the nth indexed element with,
Base Address of the Array/ArrayList + n*(memory taken by the Object/primitive data type)
eg: address of the 3rd indexed element of a char Array can be found as:
Base Address of char Array + 3*1byte
